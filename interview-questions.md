# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: How many times a function is repeated.

  Researched answer: Iteration is the process of executing a block of code over and over again until a condition is met.



2. The built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: There has to be an array attatched to .map() in order for the function to work. 

  Researched answer: The value of the array at the current iteration (required).

The index of the array at the current iteration (optional).

The array the higher-order function was called on (optional).



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Assigns variables from an array by taking it apart.

  Researched answer: What's great about the destructuring assignment is that it allows you to take something like an array or an object and unpack their values into individual variables.



4. What is the difference between an object and a class?

  Your answer: An object is just a container for a name while a class is a type of function that includes objects and their properties.

  Researched answer: Classes are a particular type of function that contain data and behavior. Classes are the blueprints of objects. Objects are collections of key:value pairs.


5. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer: when a child class is using the same object from a parent class, super() is used to use the information.

  Researched answer:  Within in the constructor method we call super() which passes the attributes from the constructor in the parent class



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.

In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
